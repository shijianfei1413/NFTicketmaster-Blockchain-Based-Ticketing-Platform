# NFTicketmaster: Blockchain-Based Ticketing Platform

## Overview
NFTicketmaster is a blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize event ticketing by leveraging NFT technology. This project aims to address common issues like counterfeit tickets, lack of transparency, and ticket scalping by creating a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for event tickets.

## Key Features
- **NFT-Based Tickets**: Each ticket is an NFT, ensuring authenticity, transparency, and traceability.
- **Smart Contracts**: All ticket transactions are governed by smart contracts, providing a secure and automated trading process.
- **Gas Fees**: Transactions, especially those involving higher-priced tickets, incur gas fees to discourage scalping and maintain market fairness.
